<h2>Location</h2>

<p>Meridian City is located on the West Coast, near the territory of Baja California. The climate is warm, especially during the summer, but the cool breeze from the ocean keeps the air temperate.</p>

<h2>Government</h2>
<p>This city's government consists of the beloved mayor, <b>Robert Evans</b>, and the council made up of ten members, chosen by the public as their representatives. </p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Meridian City was founded in 1834 by a group of settlers separated from the Oregon Trail travelers, who eventually made their way south. Originially called Waterstown, the name was changed when the population steadily grew, making it more recognizable as a city rather than the small fishing town it once was.</p>
