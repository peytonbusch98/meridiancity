<h1>Meridian City Attractions</h1>
<h2>Free Attractions</h2>
<p> There are plenty of free attractions here in Meridian City! Our multiple beaches are all open to the public and can be accessed anytime between 8am-9pm.</p>
<p>If you want to do something a little less sandy, Meridian City offers a couple free museums that range in subjects from historical to art. These museums are all free but do accept donations to help pay for day to day expenses.</p>
<p>Our city's parks are also some of the best in the nation. They include state of the art playground equipment as well as the best kept facilities in California. All of this is free to the public and is always being improved!</p>
<h2>Paid Attractions</h2>
<p>Meridian City also has paid attractions for families and individuals as well. Everything from water parks and theme parks to movie theaters and a top five ranked zoo in the world.</p>
